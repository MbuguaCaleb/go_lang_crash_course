**Notes**

```
Go does not come with a lot of third package liblary support.

We must import them from the Standard Liblary

a good example is the string Package.

```

**Pointer Wrapper Values**

```

Go makes a copy of these but does not update them when the data changes

(a)Strings

(b)Ints

(c)Floats

(d)Booleans

(e)Arrays

(f)Structs

```

Pointer Wrapper Values

```

Go makes a copy and updates them when the data changes.


```

**Receiver functions**

```
Helps us to add custom functions in our structs...

```

**User Input**

```
Whenever we get user input from the terminal, it always comes in form of a string.

```

**Inerfaces**

```

They capture similarities between unrelated classes and Objectss.

Helps us write clean code without repeating ourselves.
