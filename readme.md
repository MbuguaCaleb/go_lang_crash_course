**Notes**

```
Go does not come with a lot of third package liblary support.

We must import them from the Standard Liblary

a good example is the string Package.

```

**Pointer Wrapper Values**

```

Go makes a copy of these but does not update them when the data changes

(a)Strings

(b)Ints

(c)Floats

(d)Booleans

(e)Arrays

(f)Structs

```

Pointer Wrapper Values

Go makes a copy and updates them when the data changes.
